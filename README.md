### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a technology agnostic software engineer, willing to learn any new technology to get the job done. I gravitate towards math, chess and problem solving in daily life. I am a recent graduate of an elite software engineering bootcamp and eagerly waiting to start the next phase of this amazing journey. 

I am also a US Soccer Federation certified coach and US Chess Federation amateur rated tournament player
